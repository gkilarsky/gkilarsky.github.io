			<span class="info">
			Similar to Amazon's new "Amazon Go" campaign, Cleveland State University will now
			be offering students the opportunity to "grab-and-go." Due to the incredible amount
			of classes and learning that students are responsible for in today's educational
			environment, Cleveland State has elected to severely shorten the length of time and
			the amount of hastle involved in purchasing textbooks and school supplies from the
			university's generous book store. The basic idea is the following...
			<br><br>
			Students and faculty will be asked to swipe their university identification cards in
			order to enter the store. Once inside, individuals will then be able to pick various
			items and supplies from specially-designed shelves, which are built to detect how much
			of what item was taken. Then, once the student or faculty member leaves the premesis,
			the amound due to the school will be credited to that individuals CampusNet account.
			<br><br>
			It is said that this process will help busy students and teachers alike quickly grab what
			they need and continue with their packed schedules.
